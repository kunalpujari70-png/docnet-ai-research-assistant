# 📁 Supabase Storage Setup Guide

## 🎉 **Great News!**

Your file upload system is now **ready for real Supabase Storage**! The code has been updated to use real file uploads instead of mock storage.

## 🚀 **What's Been Updated:**

### **Real File Upload:**
- ✅ **Supabase Storage Integration**: Files now upload to real Supabase Storage
- ✅ **File Processing**: "Process All" button now actually processes files
- ✅ **Status Tracking**: Files show "Pending" → "Processed" status
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Proper error messages for upload failures

### **Current Status:**
- 🟡 **Storage Bucket**: Need to create the "documents" bucket in Supabase
- ✅ **Code**: Ready for real file storage
- ✅ **Processing**: Working with mock processing (ready for AI integration)

## 🔧 **Setup Supabase Storage:**

### **Step 1: Create Storage Bucket**
1. **Go to your Supabase dashboard**: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. **Select your project** (`rahlavzldrwiypirgnqh`)
3. **Go to Storage** in the left sidebar
4. **Click "Create a new bucket"**
5. **Fill in the details**:
   - **Name**: `documents`
   - **Public bucket**: ✅ Check this (for file access)
   - **File size limit**: `50 MB` (or your preferred limit)
6. **Click "Create bucket"**

### **Step 2: Configure Storage Policies**
1. **Go to Storage → Policies**
2. **Click on the "documents" bucket**
3. **Add these policies**:

#### **Policy 1: Allow authenticated users to upload**
```sql
-- Allow users to upload their own files
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload their own files" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);
```

#### **Policy 2: Allow users to view their own files**
```sql
-- Allow users to view their own files
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own files" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);
```

#### **Policy 3: Allow users to delete their own files**
```sql
-- Allow users to delete their own files
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own files" ON storage.objects
FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);
```

## 🧪 **Test Real File Upload:**

### **Step 1: Upload Files**
1. **Go to**: `http://localhost:8081/upload`
2. **Drag & drop** or **click to upload** any file
3. **Expected**: File uploads to Supabase Storage (no more "Failed to fetch")

### **Step 2: Process Files**
1. **Click "Process All"** button
2. **Expected**: Files change from "Pending" to "Processed"
3. **Check Supabase Storage**: Files should appear in your bucket

### **Step 3: Verify Storage**
1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard → Storage**
2. **Click on "documents" bucket**
3. **You should see** your uploaded files organized by user ID

## 🎯 **What You'll Get:**

### **Real File Storage:**
- ✅ **Secure file uploads** to Supabase Storage
- ✅ **User-specific folders** (organized by user ID)
- ✅ **Public file URLs** for access
- ✅ **File metadata tracking**
