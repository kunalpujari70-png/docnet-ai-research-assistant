# 🧪 Testing Guide - AI Research Portal

## ✅ **Fixed Issues:**

### 1. **Authentication Flow**
- ✅ **Automatic Sign-In Redirect**: App now redirects to `/signin` when not authenticated
- ✅ **Mock Authentication**: Works with any email/password for testing
- ✅ **Guest Access**: "Continue as Guest" button works
- ✅ **Session Persistence**: Stays logged in across page refreshes
- ✅ **Proper Logout**: Clears session and redirects to sign-in

### 2. **File Upload**
- ✅ **Authentication Check**: File upload now works with mock authentication
- ✅ **Mock File Storage**: Files are stored locally for testing
- ✅ **No More "Authentication Failed"**: Upload works for both mock and real users

### 3. **Protected Routes**
- ✅ **All Routes Protected**: `/`, `/upload`, `/frameworks`, `/settings`, `/simple`
- ✅ **Sign-In Page Unprotected**: `/signin` accessible without authentication
- ✅ **Redirect After Login**: Returns to original page after successful sign-in

### **Step 4: Test Logout**
1. Click "🚪 Sign Out" in sidebar
2. **Expected**: Redirected to sign-in page
3. Try accessing any protected route
4. **Expected**: Redirected back to sign-in

### **Step 5: Test Session Persistence**
